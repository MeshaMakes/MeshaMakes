### My Tech Journey 👩‍💻

In January of 2019 I picked up a Java course at my college and from then on I started taking coding seriously, I mainly focused on Java for three months then picked up C++ as well to get a feel of it. Alongside C++ I was learn Data Structures and Algorithms and that continued for another three months, summer approached and I decided that I was gonna join #100DaysOfCode in learning Web Development which was documented on my twitter and I did that for awhile but I soon found other interests.

While participating in the challenge I picked up on many different areas on programming that I wasn't yet aware of and decided to give all of them a try. In September of 2019 I picked up on Android Development in Java and it has been one of the things that has stuck with me, I love it and since then I've many a handfull of finished apps but nothing released yet.
